 Auto Tweet Generator using Multi-AI Agents
This project is an intelligent tweet-generation system that uses multiple AI agents working together to create, refine, and optimize Twitter posts for virality and engagement.

🧠 About the Project
The system simulates the thought process of a professional Twitter influencer. It leverages multiple agents to:

Generate a tweet based on a given topic.

Reflect on the quality and impact of that tweet.

Iterate through a feedback loop until an optimal tweet is produced.

Built using LangChain, LangGraph, and Google's Gemini model, the agents work in coordination to generate and critique content—making the final tweet more impactful and refined.

⚙️ Core Components
Generation Agent: Crafts an initial tweet using the topic input.

Reflection Agent: Critiques the tweet and suggests improvements.

LangGraph Loop: A structured message graph that alternates between generation and reflection until an ideal output is reached.

Streamlit Frontend (Optional): Offers a simple UI for users to enter topics and view the tweet generation process.
